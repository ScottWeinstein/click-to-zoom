A tool for joining zoom calls with a click (or two)

## Setup

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v12+
2. clone this repo
3. `npm install`
4. `gatsby develop`
5. edit `gatsby-config.js` - set the `zoomDomain` as needed
6. edit `index.mdx` add the meetings your need
7. open http://localhost:8000/
8. click to zoom as needed

## limitations

1. Zoom meetings with custom ids don't work. Instead click the buttons to copy the id/pwd as needed. (fixes welcome!)
